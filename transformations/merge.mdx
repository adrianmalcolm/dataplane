# Merge transformation

**Contract version**: 0.1

**Contract status**: Draft/Early proposal

Merge transformation allows you to merge multiple dataframes into a single dataframe. Use this transformation to combine the result from multiple queries into one single result.

## Merge contract pipeline

- **ID**:
  - `merge`
- **Input format**:
  - Array of data frames / `[]*data.Frame`
  - Frames can be in any [format](./../contract)
- **Output format**:
  - Array of data frames / `[]*data.Frame` (Max Length: 1)
- **Input options**:
  - This transformation doesn't accept any options

## Merging behavior

- Input frames array must have at least one frame
- Field uniqueness will be computed by field name + field type + field labels
- First frame will be used as reference frame. (it means, frame name, applicable frame meta will be copied from first frame)
- When merging, if a field not found in existing merged frame, then it will be backfilled with nulls/defaults.
